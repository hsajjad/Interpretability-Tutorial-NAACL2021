## Abstract
Deep neural networks have constantly pushed the state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing and are considered as the de-facto modeling approach in solving complex NLP tasks such as machine translation, summarization and question-answering. Despite the proven efficacy of deep neural networks at-large, their opaqueness is a major cause of concern. 
 
In this tutorial, we will present research work on interpreting fine-grained components of a neural network model from two perspectives, i) fine-grained analysis, and  ii) causation analysis. The former is a class of methods to analyze neurons with respect to a desired language concept or a task. The latter studies the role of neurons and input features in explaining the decisions made by the model. We will also discuss how fine-grained interpretation and causation analysis can connect towards better interpretability of model prediction. Finally, we will walk you through various toolkits that facilitate fine-grained interpretation and causation analysis of neural models.
